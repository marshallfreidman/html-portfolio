<h1>The Best Movies According to Marshall</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King</h3>
<p>I think this is the best movie of all time. The music, scenery, acting, and plot all come together to make one of cinemas greatest fantasies.</p>

<h3>Lost in Translation</h3>
<p>This is a story about being lost, and finding oneself in a chance encounter in a strange world.<p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>This is one of the movie greats with excellent action. It was one of my favorite movies growing up.</p>
